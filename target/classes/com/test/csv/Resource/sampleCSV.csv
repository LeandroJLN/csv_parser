I had just stepped off the stage at the Global Health Summit at the Hyatt Hotel in Jacksonville, fresh from giving a talk on how AI & tech would change the game in healthcare. The audience was baffled! Nobody got it back then. Some in the audience even thought I was stoned, luckily, they didn‚Äôt stone me off the stage. That night, I found myself at the Hyatt bar, as one does. Drink in hand and re-living the anti-climax presentation. The summit host walked past, gave me an awkward smile while gazing at my drink, as if to say ‚Äî aha, so this is why you were hallucinating on stage! Was I wrong? Legend has it that my grand-dad was the biggest gambler of his era, and I was named after him. So, I just smiled back and placed my biggest bet on AI becoming a winner. I knew I was way ahead of the curve.Fast forward to 2025, I‚Äôve now consulted over 100+ high-end companies on AI integration into Healthcare & Medtech. Within 6 months of joining LinkedIn in 2024, I was ranked #1 in the UK & Top 5 globally in ''Healthcare & Health Tech Experts'' (Favikon Rankings).

A holding company","Charlotte, North Carolina, United States",United States,Real Estate,Chief Executive Officer,2349,"Every great story starts with a why. At Atomico, LLC, our why has always been clear: to use technology to transform lives. For over fifteen years, we've leveraged Operation Research and Information Engineering to champion innovation believing that behind every data point is a human story.This belief led us most recently to the Mighty Linehauler project, revolutionizing FedEx Ground linehaul trucking. We saw an opportunity to make a real difference, recognizing that truckers - the unsung heroes of our economy - deserved more than just a job. They deserved a fulfilling career and respect.But purpose-driven journeys often lead to unexpected places. As we pushed the boundaries in logistics, we found ourselves at the cutting edge of a new frontier: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.That's why the next chapter of our story promises to be so exhilarating: I will be joining Aizzia SARL, a groundbreaking AI startup at Paris‚Äôs renowned Station F, as a pre-seed investor, EIR and Directeur de Programme IA/ML.Why Aizzia? Because it's the next logical step in my mission. AI and ML aren't just buzzwords - they're powerful tools that we‚Äôre passionate about and believe when used with unwavering purpose, can solve humanity's most pressing challenges. From healthcare to education, from climate change to logistics, AI can unlock new possibilities.But here's the crucial part: just like in our work with truckers, we believe the true power of AI lies not in replacing humans, but in empowering them. At Aizzia, our goal is to create AI that serves humanity, augments human potential, and helps people live fuller lives.This new role isn't a departure from our previous mission - it's an evolution. We're taking everything we've learned about using technology to empower people and applying it to the exciting world of AI and ML.Our why remains the same: to use technology to make lives better, to empower individuals, to solve real-world problems.

While others chased leads through cold calls and expensive ads, I discovered what elite entrepreneurs already knew.Personal branding is the ultimate client magnet.

I learned how to make sense of complex industries (global transport markets, anyone?) and drive growth.At diffferent (yes, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs spelled), I helped brands like Audi and Zalando identify growth opportunities and design innovative business strategies. And at Deloitte‚Äôs Innovation & Ventures team, I worked on building future-proof businesses with cutting-edge tech.One highlight?

A business into a force for systemic change?For over 30 years, I‚Äôve been answering these questions through transformative leadership, scale-up strategy, and impact investment. With 4 successful exits, 12 years in venture capital, and hundreds of businesses mentored, I‚Äôve learned one truth: the future belongs to leaders who balance purpose and profit.It all started at Accenture, where I supported growth-stage businesses facing uncertainty. But my defining moment came when I co-founded eight ventures‚Äîfrom fintech and SaaS to education platforms and green tech. Four achieved successful exits, proving that businesses scale when vision meets strategy.As an investor, I‚Äôve focused on ventures that create economic and social value across Sub-Saharan Africa. Partnering with entrepreneurs in agriculture, healthcare, education, and conservation, I‚Äôve seen that scaling businesses in emerging markets requires more than capital‚Äîit demands trust, cultural intelligence, and systems that align global resources with local solutions.Today, I work with scale-ups, founders, and investors to solve the challenges of growth:‚Ä¢How do you transition from founder to CEO without losing your vision?‚Ä¢How do you scale systems that amplify impact while avoiding burnout?‚Ä¢How do you build teams that drive innovation and execution?With 4 exits, 12 years in VC, and hands-on experience in high-growth environments, I help leaders master the art of scaling‚Äîboth their businesses and themselves.What I BelieveBusiness isn‚Äôt just about profits; it‚Äôs about leaving something bigger than yourself.

I was 23.Responsible for 8 salespeople.Leading a ¬£5M+ business....all with no prior leadership experience.I was out of my depth, FULL of imposter syndrome, and had little support.Quickly, I realised that what made me a good salesperson would not make me a good people leader. I had to reinvent myself. I was desperate to do a good job 1) For me and my career and 2) for Gartner and my boss, who trusted me.So, I began to develop myself. I studied the best leaders in the world. I accessed their content, masterminds, courses...  just about anything I could get my hands on. On the way, I built a community of other managers and leaders on the same journey. We shared, learnt and grew with each other.The community was invaluable... but I had a new problem.I couldn't balance my day job with my responsibility for the community. So I quit as Gartner's least-qualified sales manager.... and became the world's least qualified Business Owner of a management development company.Deja Vu:- Out of my depth- Imposter syndrome- No experience in developing managers. But it hit me... this flaw is my exact value. I didn't have all the answers (*spoiler* no one does).But I knew exactly what the managers of today are struggling with, and I could connect them with what the best leaders in the world are doing to solve it. Since starting, we've spent thousands of hours and over ¬£250,000 investigating what the very best managers in the world are doing and reporting back on this. Not the theory. But what exactly do they do to deliver exponential results. This investigation is an ongoing journey I am documenting here. But the summary so far: FOLLOWER-FIRST LEADERSHIP.The single biggest differentiator between an average and high-performing manager is FOLLOWERSHIP. You can't lead if no one is following.High-performing leaders have a team that will run through a brick wall for them. I continue to document my learnings whilst building 10X Managers - the Management Development company I'd actually have loved to have access to as a manager. At 10X Managers, we empower managers to follow the world's best, as Follower-First Leaders, who deliver 10X the results of average leaders, delight their people, and reinvent the business for everyone's long-term success.

I have over 28 years‚Äô experience in professional practice working with International Mid-Market Companies, Large Corporates and Entrepreneurs.  I have developed a methodology for international audits that my clients really value. There are some key principles to the methodology, but the process can be flexed to each client‚Äôs circumstances delivering a tailored and efficient audit experience. I deliver regular training to my team who are skilled and take ownership for delivering the benefits associated with the methodology on a consistent basis. If CFOs value their time, dislike late surprises and think meeting deadlines are important, this methodology is the perfect fit. I work with CFOs to ensure that they are clear on accounting matters and whether they are black or white or judgemental. Where they are judgemental, I work with my clients to ensure that the judgements made are reasonable, commercial, and robust. CFOs regularly comment that they have received a better audit experience working with ECOVIS than they have received working with some of our competitors and I am very proud of this feedback.   International Mid-Market CFOs tend to be self-sufficient and time poor. I make working with me easy and efficient by responding quickly, clearly, and succinctly to technical questions. I also join the CFOs finance team where there are resource constraints or skills gaps to deliver projects, particularly in the areas of corporate finance and international expansion. I build strong relationships with CFOs to enable them to maximise the positive impact they can have in and on their companies. CFO clients like the holistic approach I take to working with them. I take ownership and responsibility for all services provided to clients and ensure all advice is co-ordinated with the ‚Äòbig picture‚Äô in mind. I use my technical skills and experience of working with over 250 companies in the last 28 years to be a reliable and trusted advisor to CFOs of International Mid-Market companies.

Struggling with finances while working a minimum-wage job, I realized I needed to boost my income. This led to a game-changing opportunity during my sophomore year when I teamed up with a peer to launch a local food delivery business.That was my initial taste of business, and I quickly fell in love with the endless possibilities it offered.As our business evolved, the need for effective marketing became evident. This is where I found my true calling. Through a combination of experimentation, determination, and plenty of YouTube tutorials, I delved into running paid Google Ads. The results, especially in terms of the return on our investment, left me both amazed and inspired.The pivotal moment came when I started contemplating the essence of every successful business - customers. How to acquire them efficiently? Digital marketing seemed to hold the answer.With this in mind, I embarked on my journey into the world of digital marketing. I began offering my marketing services to a diverse range of businesses, including dentists, mechanics, Ecommerce ventures, and insurance agents. While there were successes, there were also valuable lessons learned from failures. I was on a fast-paced learning curve, and I developed a solid foundation to consistently deliver better results.

It‚Äôs called Customer Synergy Engine, a system that information, technology and software providers can use to improve customer retention and expansion. Through this system, you‚Äôll identify avenues for enhanced and highly profitable revenue growth through a cheap, efficient, and dependable source of leads and new revenue: your current customers.When you harness Customer Synergy Engine for your business, you will: ‚úÖ Improve net revenue retention by reducing leakage and improving expansion‚úÖ Increase consistency and sustainability of  top- and bottom-line performance ‚úÖ Stop firefighting to address customer crises  (negotiations and saves) at  the 11th hour‚úÖ Build customer relationships and positive word-of-mouth to propel your business forward  Most consulting programs are about quick fixes and playing defense, but not ours.

In 2024, I developed an AI tech accelerator for Opportunity International, with our Farmer AI initiative featured in Bloomberg and my work featured in Time Magazine.Whether developing tech solutions for B2B, B2C, or farmers in Rwanda, I've found that problem-solving requires consistent skills: listening intently, asking probing questions, challenging accepted norms, and confronting discomfort within myself and others with honesty and grace.On a personal note, I've lived in the US, Europe & Asia, received my yoga teacher cert in Bali, and consider the Pacific Northwest home where I love to go birding & hiking with Lala, my adventurous King Charles.","Data Science, Digital Transformation, Change Management, Software Development, Customer Experience, Program Management, Product Management, Information Technology, Marketing Strategy, Digital Marketing, Product Development, Social Media, Strategic Planning, Customer Insight, Nonprofits, Strategy, Analytics, Start-ups, Direct Marketing, Marketing",Opportunity International,https://linkedin.com/company/opportunity-international,opportunity-international,Catalyst-in-Residence,Dec 2023 - Present,,Enabled a provider of humanitarian solutions with an AI lab and org-wide global innovation program to bring the greatest tech advances to those who need them most.

After making 300% gains in my demo account (right for the wrong reasons) I felt ‚Äúready‚Äù to trade with real money.Then the COVID-19 market crash hit and wiped out my savings. Losing everything was tough, but instead of letting it defeat me, I saw it as a wake-up call.I needed to invest in education. I earned two Level 5 financial certifications and graduated with honours from ESADE University, excelling in every finance course. I joined the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment (CISI) in London and travelled globally to learn from top investors like Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmiller.But I realized knowledge wasn't enough.I began managing investments for close friends and family, shouldering the responsibility of their trust. While working at Quadriga Asset Management's hedge fund, I predicted the 2022 market downturn. Acting on that insight, I safeguarded my clients' investments, and my assets under management grew from ‚Ç¨10,000 to seven figures.Yet, something was missing.I had many ideas I couldn't execute due to my tech skills being limited to Excel.I needed more powerful tools to break my limits.I didn't have a background in tech and was afraid of coding, but I pushed myself to program a simple Monte Carlo simulation script.And guess what? It worked! And I was hooked.Gone were my limitations. Gone was being stuck. Gone was the inability to test my ideas.Combining finance knowledge with powerful computing tools was a game-changer.Noticing a technological gap in the asset management industry, I was determined to make a change.In 2022, I founded Alpha Rho Technologies LLC with a clear vision: to lead the technological revolution in asset management.Now, I'm combining my passion for finance with cutting-edge technology to reshape the future of investing.","Finance, Corporate Finance, Teamwork, Asset Management, Analytical Skills, Financial Advisory, Investment Management, Python programming, Investments, Python (Programming Language), Trading, Financial Markets, Statistical Data Analysis, Decision-Making, Mathematical Modeling, Macroeconomics, Financial Derivatives, Python Programming, English, Spanish",The Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment (The CISI),,,Member,Feb 2023 - Present,"London, England, United Kingdom",Membership number: 291079,Esade,https://www.linkedin.com/school/esade,esade,Bachelor of Business Administration - BBA,Oct 2019 - Jun 2023,"Honors: Corporate Finance, Asset pricing",Frankfurt School of Finance & Management,https://www.linkedin.com/school/frankfurtschool,frankfurtschool,Bachelor of Science in Business Administration,Sep 2022 - Feb 2023,"Fall Exchange Student.Electives: Risk management, Evidence based decision making, sales and trading, Accounting and capital markets and Asset management.",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAC4sgJkBh2YY7dphDjHuJ5iVIgRhBak41zk%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,manuelritsch,alpha-rho-technologies,774668441,ACoAAC4sgJkBh2YY7dphDjHuJ5iVIgRhBak41zk,No,No,4.01003E+15,Out of Network,2/13/2025,2/13/2025,Deleted Phantom (5561152459466678),Deleted Phantom (5561152459466678)

I didn‚Äôt realize then how much those lessons would shape my passion for marketing. My professional path began in Higher Education, where I started as a campus administrator focused on marketing, enrollment management, and student development. Promoting the value of higher education to students from diverse backgrounds taught me a lot about ‚Äúmarketing the intangible.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt just about numbers or programs; it was about connecting with human aspirations and potential.As I moved into roles like Director of Student Development, VP of Operations, and eventually Campus President, I discovered a universal truth: Every institution has its own story to tell. My mission was to bring those stories to life, helping them resonate with students, families, and communities. Higher education wasn‚Äôt just a career for me‚Äîit was a way to foster connection, growth, and transformation.Today, I‚Äôm grateful to apply my experience and purpose across different yet connected organizations.In 2019, I joined The Pink Collective, partnering with Founder and Creative Director Roly Rodriguez. We shared a vision: managing an agency that empowers positive brands. Having led a student-focused marketing agency, Tribeca Marketing Group, the move to Pink allowed me to explore new creative horizons. Now known as Pink Studio Central, our mission remains clear: helping brands grow through campaigns, content, and connections that resonate deeply.My journey also led me to Circle of One Marketing. In 2016, a meeting with Suzan McDowell, Founder and CEO, sparked a lasting partnership. Circle had already built an unparalleled reputation in Public Relations and Event Management, and our shared passion for purposeful marketing made collaboration natural. Today, as the Circle‚Äôs VP of Brand Development, I get to combine expertise and resources from both agencies, delivering greater value to every client.For me, marketing isn‚Äôt just a profession, it‚Äôs about building connections and fostering growth. Whether I‚Äôm mentoring small businesses, leading workshops, or developing campaigns, I bring the grit of my Bronx roots and a diverse marketing perspective to everything I do. Throughout my professional journey one thing that has remained consistent: Every story matters.Let‚Äôs connect! I‚Äôd love to hear your story and explore how we can grow together.","Admissions, Enrollment Management, Higher Education, Retaining Customers, Adult Education, Staff Development, Student Financial Aid, Student Recruiting, CampusVue, Student Affairs, Campus, Career Counseling, Academic Administration, Student Engagement, Distance Learning, Further Education, Marketing, Educational Leadership, Resume Writing, Curriculum Design","Marketing Group, LLC",https://linkedin.com/company/ribeca-marketing-group-llc,ribeca-marketing-group-llc,President,Jun 2018 - Present,"Hollywood, FL",,Howard University,https://www.linkedin.com/school/howard-university,howard-university,,,,New York University,https://www.linkedin.com/school/new-york-university,new-york-university,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAELkDIBh3mTZrty1zjr17k5sVpnaK_u7j8%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,richard-mcculloch-702a575,pink-studio-central,17535026,ACoAAAELkDIBh3mTZrty1zjr17k5sVpnaK_u7j8,No,No,7.42369E+15,1st,2/25/2025,2/25/2025,Untitled LinkedIn Profile Scraper,[Deleted Phantom] (undefined)
